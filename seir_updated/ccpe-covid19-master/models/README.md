# Models

This directory stores the set of models created for this work.
All of these models are specified in [HAML](https://github.com/PRETgroup/modular-code-generation/blob/master/specs/HAML.md).

## [Plant Models](plants)

The epidemiological models used to simulate the dynamics of COVID-19 in a population.

## [Controller Models](controllers)

Various controllers that are created to capture the government intervention techniques used to combat COVID-19.

## [Systems](systems)

Complete systems which combine a single plant and controller together which were used as test cases for the research.

## [Generated C](generated_c)

Pre-generated software code for running the above models.
This is provided in order to allow for using these models without a need for the HAML compiler.
