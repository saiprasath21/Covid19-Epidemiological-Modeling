The following assumptions were made considering the lack of information/description:

(1) c_iso parameter is the percentage of contacts that is reduced due to contact reduction. We assume that this value is valid only between t_contstart and t_contend.
In all other cases the value is zero.

(2) c_home parameter is the percentage of contact prevented due to home isolation. We assume that this value is valid only between t_isostart and t_isoend.
In all other cases the value is zero.

(3) Internal stages have been considered for each of the infection stage. We assume it to be 2 (for simplicity, no other reason). But the duration of each infection stage can be 
altered as needed. Due to the lack of features to create arrays, the code has to be manually modified for changing the number of stages.

This is a problem with this framework. 

(4) Functions/equations for tmax and c(t) have not been given. We have considered c(t) to be same as the c_iso parameter based on the same conditions (discussed in point 1).
tmax is not used anywhere in the equations, it's purpose remains unidentified. 

(5) The new cases in every step is equal to phi * P2 as these are the cases becoming infected every step.
A different equation is described in the paper. (Check this contradiction --> correct in version 1.1)

(7) All the derived variables can be computed from the 'out.csv' if needed. 

NOTE:
Check the power fucntion, variables are not replaced properly in it.
