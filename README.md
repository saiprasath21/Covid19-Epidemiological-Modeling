# Covid19-Epidemiological-Modeling

## Summary
- Analysed various epidemiological models: SEIR, Covid Sim and Stochastic models to understand the spread of the Covid-19 virus. 
- Utilized hybrid timed automata models to achieve compositional modeling by separting the disease dynamics (plant) from the decision making process (controller). 
- Generated control policies to control the spread of the virus while balancing the health and economic consequences of restrictions and Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI). 
- Analysed the tradeoff using the epsilon constraint technique and particle swarm optimization. 

## Files and Directories

- seir_updated: Implement an advanced version of the SEIR model. 
- micro_stochastic, stochastic: Implement different ways to model stochastic micro-models. 
- Tradeoff: Analyses the tradeoff between the health and economic condequences of restrictions.
